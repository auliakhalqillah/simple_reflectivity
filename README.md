# Simple Reflectivity
The 1D synthetic waveform has been generated by using simple reflectivity method. It was generated with duration in 30 minutes (dt = 0.01), the wavelet's frequency of 40 Hz, consists of 3 layers model and 5000 random source points. The velocity model of AK135 was used in this simulation.
